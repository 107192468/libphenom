 * # Jobs
 * Jobs describe a parcel of work.  Jobs may be triggered or dispatched
 * in one of a number of "run classes".  There are three run classes:
 *
 * - Immediate. The work is dispatched immediately on the calling thread.
 * - NBIO. The work is dispatched when a descriptor is signalled for I/O.
 * - Pool. The work is queued to a thread pool and is dispatched as soon as a
 *   worker becomes available.  libPhenom allows multiple pools to be defined to
 *   better partition and prioritize your workload.

 * update the heartbeat after performing the barrier.  This ensures
 * that all worker threads are healthy and making progress.
 * The default value for this is `5000` milliseconds; it should be
 * more frequent than your Gimli watchdog interval.  You may disable
 * barrier and heartbeat by setting this option to `0`.
 *
 * `$.nbio.max_sleep` specifies the maximum duration that an nbio
 * or worker thread will be idle.  The default value for this is
 * `5000` milliseconds.  This is important when it comes to handling
 * deferred memory reclamation; after the max sleep expires, and if
 * no events are due, the worker will call ph_thread_epoch_poll()
