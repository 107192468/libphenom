/**
 * The phenom counter subsystem provides a set of functions that

 * counter values.
 *
 * These values may be modified and queried atomically via the provided API.
 *
 * Functions are provided to introspect the hierarchy and groups of
 * related counters can be read consistently.  Note that the system does
 * not provide a means for snapshotting the entire counter hierarchy.
 *
 * Note that this doesn't replace the common/stats functionality that

 * These can then be exported via Thrift if desired.
